Hi everyone, now that I have done [six Ludum Dare games](https://ldjam.com/users/hydezeke/games) I think it might be helpful to type up my 'process' (if I can call it that).

**I'm going to mark each paragraph with an icon denoting what type of thing I'm explaining. Some sections are legitimate advice, and some are very specific quirks to how I work. This will cover all aspects of the game creation process (programming, design, visuals, audio) and how I try to fit it into a few days.**
