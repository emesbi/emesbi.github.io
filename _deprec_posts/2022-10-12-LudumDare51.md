Hi everyone, now that I have done [six Ludum Dare games](https://ldjam.com/users/hydezeke/games) I think it might be helpful to type up my 'process' (if I can call it that).

**I'm going to mark each paragraph with an icon denoting what type of thing I'm explaining. Some sections are legitimate advice, and some are very specific quirks to how I work. This will cover all aspects of the game creation process (programming, design, visuals, audio) and how I try to fit it into a few days.**

# How I Do Ludum Dare #

Not a guide.

### I Work Mostly Alone

![Lifestyle](/docs/assets/images/blog_life.png) Something I must note about myself: the way I design is very solitary. I love people and talking to others, but it is very difficult for me to discuss design with others while I am in the middle of making a design. **Brainstorming with others is useful to me but it must come _after_ I have worked out preliminary ideas in my head.**


### Working With Artists

![Idea](/docs/assets/images/blog_idea.png) I mostly work with composers, but these composers sometimes do visual art and writing for me.

### Get Placeholder Assets Early

![Idea](/docs/assets/images/blog_idea.png) Once my idea is fleshed out, I try to get as many placeholder assets into the game as soon as possible. Some of these unfortunately **will be final** inevitably, but you must get them in.

* Placeholder music (at least one track) - when in doubt just add a drum beat and be done with it.
* Placeholder sounds - Get some random sounds (or just clap into a microphone) and duplicate them out. Do it for every single interaction in your game. These will be your placeholder sounds. You will overwrite most of them later, but **sound feedback is a must**.
* Placeholder art - Do whatever you can to get some art into the game early. Block out what colors you are using **day one**. Refer to online color palettes if you like and get some cubes / squares etc into the game right away.


### You need to know what your game will feel like -early-

This means you must make your game *playable* as soon as possible. Do not choose a game idea that's too complicated you can't play it day 1.
